# Tourism-Recommendations-System
Abstract: The tourism industry faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a decline in travel and tourist activities. This has particularly affected local tour guides and small-scale tourism businesses, who rely heavily on tourists for their livelihood.
In this report, I propose an AI-Driven Tourism Recommendation System that aims to enhance the travel experiences of tourists while boosting the business opportunities for local tour guides. The recommendation system uses a hybrid approach, combining Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques, to provide personalized travel recommendations based on tourists' preferences, previous travel history, and interests.
This recommendation system is designed to help local guides identify and connect with tourists who are most likely to enjoy their tours, thereby increasing their chances of securing bookings. It also allows tourists to discover activities and places that align with their interests, creating a more engaging and fulfilling travel experience. The report includes a prototype implementation and a step-by-step explanation of the model's development, integration, and potential business impact.

Problem Statement
The tourism industry, especially local tour guides and small-scale tourism businesses, has been significantly impacted due to changing travel trends and post-pandemic recovery challenges. It has become crucial for local guides to attract tourists by offering tailored experiences that match their interests. However, many guides lack the resources and expertise to identify what tourists might enjoy based on their preferences and travel history.
This project aims to predict similarities in tourists' interests and provide tailored recommendations for local experiences, tours, and activities. By identifying what types of tours are more likely to be enjoyed by different tourists, guides can better manage their offerings and promote the right experiences to the right visitors, ultimately increasing their bookings and revenue.
The recommendation technique is based on the idea that if a tourist has shown interest in certain types of activities or places, they are likely to enjoy other similar experiences. For example, if a tourist enjoys hiking, they are more likely to appreciate recommendations for nature trails or adventure tours nearby.

Dataset Description: I am going to use the following datasets for my code implementation in this report:
City Dataset: Includes CityId, CityName, and CountryId for 9143 entries, providing information about various cities and their associated countries.
Continent Dataset: Contains ContenentId and Contenent with 6 entries, helping categorize countries into their respective continents.
Country Dataset: Features CountryId, Country, and RegionId with 165 entries, enabling a mapping between countries and regions.
Attraction Dataset: Provides data on AttractionId, AttractionCityId, AttractionTypeId, Attraction, and AttractionAddress for 30 different attractions, allowing the recommendation system to identify points of interest.
Visit Mode Dataset: Contains VisitModeId and VisitMode with 6 entries, specifying different modes of travel or visit preferences (e.g., guided tours, self-exploration).
Region Dataset: Includes Region, RegionId, and ContentId with 22 entries, helping categorize different regions for targeted recommendations.
Transaction Dataset: Contains details about user visits and ratings, including TransactionId, UserId, VisitYear, VisitMonth, VisitMode, AttractionId, and Rating for 52930 entries. This dataset is crucial for analyzing tourist behavior and preferences over time.



Concept Generation for the Recommendation System
The recommendation system leverages machine learning algorithms to enhance user experience by providing tailored suggestions for attractions. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the concept generation process based on the code implementation:
Algorithm Selection
Hybrid Approach: The recommendation system employs a hybrid model combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to offer comprehensive recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering: This method analyzes user ratings to identify patterns and similarities among users, suggesting attractions based on similar user preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: This technique focuses on the features of the attractions (e.g., type, address) to recommend similar items based on what the user has previously liked or rated.
Implementation of the Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Algorithm: To analyze user behavior and attraction ratings, the Apriori algorithm can be implemented to discover association rules, revealing which attractions are often rated together.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Key parameters such as minimum support, minimum confidence, minimum lift, and maximum length are adjusted to optimize the model's performance.
Minimum Support: Set to 0.003 to ensure only relevant itemsets are considered.
Minimum Confidence: Set to 20% to maintain a balance between accuracy and the number of rules generated.
Minimum Lift: Set to 3 to ensure strong association between itemsets.
Data Preparation and Normalization
Utility Matrix: The system constructs a utility matrix to represent user ratings for different attractions. This matrix is normalized to standardize the ratings, allowing for more effective comparisons.
Feature Engineering: The attraction dataset is enhanced by creating a combined feature that includes both AttractionTypeId and AttractionAddress. This allows for better content similarity calculations.
Similarity Computation
Cosine Similarity: The system computes the cosine similarity between attractions based on their features using a CountVectorizer. This allows the model to identify similar attractions effectively.
Recommendation Logic: The logic combines collaborative and content-based recommendations to provide a more robust set of suggestions for users.
User-Centric Recommendations
Personalization: The recommendation system tailors suggestions based on individual user preferences and behaviors, ensuring a personalized shopping experience for each user.
User Interaction: Users can receive recommendations based on their ratings, allowing them to explore new attractions aligned with their interests.
Results Evaluation
Feedback Loop: The effectiveness of the recommendations can be evaluated through user feedback and continuous improvement of the algorithm based on new data.
Performance Metrics: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall can be analyzed to assess the quality of the recommendations and refine the system over time.
Flask Application for AI-Driven Tourism Recommendation System
This code snippet sets up a simple web application using Flask to provide users with personalized attraction recommendations based on their User ID. The application integrates the hybrid recommendation logic we developed earlier, leveraging both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
When a user visits the application, they are greeted with a user-friendly interface that prompts them to enter their User ID. Upon submission, the application processes the input and returns a list of recommended attractions. This interactive approach ensures that users receive tailored suggestions that enhance their travel experience.
To make the application accessible over the internet, we utilize ngrok, which creates a secure tunnel to the local server running on port 5000. The public URL generated by ngrok allows users to access the application from anywhere. For instance, the public URL for this application is https://7c50-34-125-5-97.ngrok-free.app. This feature is particularly useful for testing and showcasing the application without deploying it on a full web server.
This Flask application embodies the essence of an AI-driven tourism recommendation system, providing users with insights into attractions tailored to their preferences, ultimately enriching their travel adventures.

The development of the AI-Driven Tourism Recommendation System marks a significant step towards enhancing the travel experience for users by leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. By utilizing a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, we have created a robust model capable of delivering personalized attraction recommendations based on individual user preferences. This innovative system not only provides users with tailored suggestions but also offers small business owners and vendors valuable insights into consumer behavior, enabling them to optimize their offerings and improve sales.
Throughout the project, we have meticulously prepared our datasets, conducted thorough analyses, and implemented the recommendation logic using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask. The use of a pickle file to save the model data ensures that we can easily load and deploy our model in a production environment. This approach highlights the importance of building scalable and maintainable solutions in the field of data science and machine learning.
Looking ahead, we recognize the necessity of making this application accessible to a broader audience. To achieve this, we need to upload our application to a cloud platform. Deploying the AI-Driven Tourism Recommendation System to the cloud will ensure that it is available to users anytime and anywhere, facilitating real-time interactions and enhancing user engagement. Cloud deployment will also provide scalability, allowing the application to handle increased traffic as more users access the system.
By hosting the application on a cloud platform, we can leverage the advantages of cloud computing, such as improved reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness. This transition is crucial for maximizing the reach and impact of our recommendation system, ultimately contributing to the growth of the tourism industry and supporting small businesses in the market. In conclusion, the successful implementation and cloud deployment of the AI-Driven Tourism Recommendation System hold the potential to revolutionize the way travelers discover attractions, making their experiences more enjoyable and tailored to their unique preferences.
